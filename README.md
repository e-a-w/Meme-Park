## Why Memes?

During these times of pandemic, we want to offer a fun website where everyone can go for a quick laugh. Memes are used daily to enhance our conversations online by providing something lighthearted that everyone can relate to and easily understand.

## Who

We are a group of four Wyncode students who wanted to use this opportunity to share our love of memes and bring some positivity to the world. Thanks to the GIPHY Developer API, we were able to achieve this goal.
